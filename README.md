# Crystal Cavern

A two player game that you play in the freezing cold with a large LED array and two launchpads.

# Concept

The two players sit back to back, bathed in light by the giant screen. Temperature must be below freezing.

Players who lose can play again, but have to give up an article of clothing. First player to shiver loses.

= Gameplay =

Hit any button on the grid to claim it. You can only claim once per beat, and it has to be exactly on the beat. The edges of the screen pulse whenever the beat triggers.

If you complete a line of 8 or a square with sides of 3, then the other player has to take off an piece of clothing.

Again, first player to shiver loses.
