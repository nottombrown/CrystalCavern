# Crystal Cavern

A simple game you play in the freezing cold with a large LED array and an ableton push.

# Concept

Sit close to the giant screen, bathed in light. Temperature must be below freezing.

Each time you lose, you can play again, but you have to give up an article of clothing. Repeat until you get too cold to play.

Anyone turning blue will be immediately disqualified.

= Gameplay =

Hit a note on the grid on the beat create a bright circle. The radius is proportional to the loudness of the bass when you the button.

Each hit paints the wall with a color. Colors slowly fade (with some randomness) from the screen. If it goes black you lose (and we play a sound).
